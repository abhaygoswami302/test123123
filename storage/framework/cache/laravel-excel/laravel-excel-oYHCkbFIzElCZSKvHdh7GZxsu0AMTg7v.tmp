Star Wars IV - Jawa & EG-6 Power Droid,Movie Masterpiece (MMS),Standard,Hot Toys,2000,Star Wars IV - Jawa & EG-6 Power Droid,"The Star Wars galaxy is vast and filled with numerous alien species and droids. Today Hot Toys is delighted to further broaden its Star Wars 1/6th scale collectibles series by introducing the Jawa and EG-6 Power Droid collectible set based on the characters' appearances in Star Wars: A New Hope!
Jawas are meter-tall humanoids completely hidden behind rough, hand-woven robes. Their faces are concealed within the dark folds of a cowl, from which peer their sickly glowing yellow eyes. They comb the deserts of Tatooine in search of discarded scrap and wayward mechanicals, incapacitate droids and drag them to their treaded fortress-homes, immense sand-scarred vehicles known as sandcrawlers, and sell their hastily refurbished junk to moisture farmers who are hard-pressed to find a better selection elsewhere.
Little more than walking batteries, power droids trundle along as directed by their owners or their programming, recharging vehicles and machinery. They are often called ""Gonk""ù droids in imitation of their simple vocalizations. There are many different models of power droid, and are common sights throughout the galaxy but little noticed despite their critical importance to both military and civilian life.
Meticulously created based on the appearance of the two characters in the movie, the 1/6th scale Jawa collectible figure features newly developed head with LED lights, skillfully tailored costume, variety of accessories, and a sand-themed figure base.
